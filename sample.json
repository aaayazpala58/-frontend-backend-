The app should do only 3 things:  1) Upload a PDF  User uploads any PDF (2–10 pages).  2) User Enters 3 Easy Rules  Examples:  - “The document must have a purpose section.”  - “The document must mention at least one date.”  - “The document must define at least one term.”  - “The document must mention who is responsible.”  - “The document must list any requirements.”  These are the type of rules your app must understand.  3) App Checks the PDF Using an LLM  For each rule, your app should:  - Ask an LLM (any model you choose)  - Decide: PASS or FAIL  - Show 1 evidence sentence  - Show short reasoning  - Show confidence score (0–100)  Example Output:  {  \"rule\": \"Document must mention a date.\",  \"status\": \"pass\",\n\"evidence\": \"Found in page 1: 'Published 2024'\",  \"reasoning\": \"Document includes a publication year.\",  \"confidence\": 92  }  What to Build:  Frontend:  - Upload PDF button  - 3 text inputs for rules  - “Check Document” button  - Table showing results  Backend:  - Extract text from PDF  - Send text + rules to an LLM  - Return PASS/FAIL + evidence + reasoning + confidence  Deliverables (48 hours):  1. GitHub Repo (frontend + backend)  2. README with instructions  3. One screenshot of the working UI\n","analysis":{"summary":"","keywordsFound":[],"warnings":[]},"samplePath":"C:\\Users\\aayaz\\Downloads\\internshala\\backend\\src\\uploads\\NIYAMR_Fullstack_Assignment.pdf"}
